# Code

This directory contains three Jupyter notebooks for analysing farmland characteristics from the Agriculture Vision 2021 dataset.

## Notebooks

- `nutrients.ipynb` - Nutrient deficiency identification
- `water.ipynb` - Water presence detection
- `weeds.ipynb` - Weed coverage analysis

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow, depending on implementation)

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure the Agriculture Vision 2021 dataset is downloaded and accessible
2. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter
3. Update the data path in the notebook if necessary
4. Run all cells sequentially

Each notebook is self-contained and can be executed independently.
